# Fixing lack of diversity in tech (resources)

- [How to fix tech conferences: an introduction](https://shadowspar.dreamwidth.org/122378.html):

  > “Preventing the problem starts with not being the problem. Educate yourself. Take that education to heart, listen to marginalized people, know how to apologize, and be an ally.”

- [Increasing diversity at your conference](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference) covers a lot of points. Among others:
  
  - General thoughts (**ask for help**, get more people involved).
  - Code of Conduct/Anti-Harassment Policy
  - **Diversity statement**, linking to [Dreamwidth's one](https://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/diversity).
  - Call for proposals (really nice advice).
  - Accomodating **beginner's content**.
  - Marketing, ticket Sales, and registration.
  - Parties and other social events.

- [Guidelines for Inclusive Language](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/guidelines-inclusive-language), always worth to be reminded of.
